Bear in mind that the heroku server may take a few seconds to spin up when initially loading the page

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install the node modules for the node/express server
   - Direct the to the root folder containing the App.js and Server.js files
   - run 'npm install'
3. Run the project with either 'npm start' or 'nodemon server'
4. In a browser, go to the following url : http://localhost:8000


NOTES
- The react project is being served from the client/build folder by the express server
